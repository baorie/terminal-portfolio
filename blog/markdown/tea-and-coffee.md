# Tea and Coffee

Dear recruiters and hiring departments,
Free tea and coffee is not a benefit. It’s a **basic workplace requirement**.

---

Why am I bringing this up? Because lots of your seem to think that by printing *"free tea and coffee"* on your job profile in bold letters make you some sort of benevolent god, handing out charity to the masses. You're not. You sound petty, cheap, and archaic. 

Some of you probably think that I'm some ungrateful little mard who doesn't know how good I've got it, and that tea and coffee costs the company money! Correct, buying tea and coffee does cost the company money. And no doubt, over the course of a year that ongoing monthly purchase is going to add up to a decent sized bill. But you know what else costs money? Water. But I’m yet to see a job profile from a recruiter with the words *”Flush the toilet as much as you want!”* in bold letters at the top of the page.

Tea and coffee is expected, and the fact that you think that it's not leaves me feeling a bit uneasy. If you're this tight around drinks for your staff, what are you going to be like with your clients? If I take this job will I be expected to run a dozen Wordpress environments off a [t2.micro](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)? Is it gonna be a huge hastle to get that Thunderbolt to HDMI adapter so I can run presentations? Are we going to be hosting all of our code repos out of free-tier Git services?

These kinds of things may sound minor, but they can add up, increasing the amount of work and hastle that we have to go through to do our jobs. There are currently way more development positions than there are developers, it's a *buyers market*. If you want good developers, you're going to have to offer substantial benefits. 

You're competitors already are.
