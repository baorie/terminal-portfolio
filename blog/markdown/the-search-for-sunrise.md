# The Search for Sunrise

Hidden in the depths of the monstrious Spotify exists a track called “[At Last, Sunrise](https://open.spotify.com/track/4z0spwzLajA7R76czkAIEE)” in an album titled “[We Were Legends](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2UjQMEOzrwt2v4L3dNrcqe)”. The track is just over 2 minutes long, so if you have a Spotify account I recommend giving it a quick listen, even if you're not into classical music. It’s a really nice track, and kinda reminds me of HBOs’ [Band of Brothers](https://open.spotify.com/track/1LcNtS9B22LgIHxd9gTGcV) theme. 

Unfortunately Spotify is the only place you can find it, so if you don't have an account you won't be able to listen. In fact, Spotify seems to be the only place online that shows any indication or acknowledgement that the artist, Maree Docia, exists. There is no [YouTube channel](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=maree+docia+youtube&oq=maree+docia+youtube&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60j35i39j69i60l2j35i39.2348j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), no [Facebook page](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=maree+docia+youtube&oq=maree+docia+youtube&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60j35i39j69i60l2j35i39.2348j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), no [Wikipedia article](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=maree+docia+wiki&oq=maree+docia+wiki&gs_l=psy-ab.3..35i39k1j0.8991.9387.0.9454.4.4.0.0.0.0.78.250.4.4.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.4.250.aGkbOqoj62c), or any significant [Google Image results](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=maree+docia&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXv-qAgJHWAhVEBsAKHXySC3MQ_AUICigB&biw=1436&bih=780) to indicate that Maree Docia exists.

There is a track by [Kelsea Ballerini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsea_Ballerini) called “[Legends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGa2-kOW810)” which features the line *“Yeah, we were legends”*, and there is a book by [M. F. Burbaugh](https://ifwgpublishing.com/author-mf-burbaugh/) titled “[We Were Legends](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00FDUE0Z8/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)”. It's fairly obvious why those two appeared in Google's search results, and just to reassure myself that I wasn't being a complete idiot I did a tiny bit of digging for these two people. 

After a couple of search queries I can tell you that Ballerini and Burbaugh were born in Tennessee and New York respectively. I can tell you that Ballerini was born on 12th September 1993, and Burbaugh joined the army in 1996. I can tell you that Ballerini became engaged to her fiancé on Christmas Day 2016, and that Burgaugh and his wife currently reside in El Paso, Texas. I can tell you all this after two minutes of searching, but I can’t tell you anything about Maree Docia.

But why? I don't think it's unreasonable to expect that an artist would have *some* online presence. Local and unsigned bands put a huge amount of effort into promoting their music online. Nearly all of them have Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, and Soundcloud accounts. Maybe it's different in the classical genre. But surely there would be some legal information at the very least, something pointing to who-so-ever owns this music, and what publishing company Maree used. Anoyingly the only result that gave me any headway on this was a snippet from Google claiming that the copyright was attributed to Maree Docia herself.

Whether or not this is standard in the classical music industry, I don't know. Searching for *"Blink 182 Spotify"* shows me that a company called Geffen Records owns the copyright to (at least some of) Blink's music.

But what does all this mean, and why should anyone care? Well, at the risk of sounding paranoid I'd like the propose the questions *"is Maree Docia real"*? There’s universities and independent researchers all around the world trying coax music from an artificial intelligence. Could Docia be an experiment from Spotify, an attempt to create music on the fly and pass it off as human creation? I reached out to Spotify to see if they could give me any information regarding Marree Docia, unfortunately they haven't responded yet.

Maybe it's time to take Maree's music to one of the AI music researchers. I wonder if any of them have created algorithms to decypher AI generated music from human generated music.

Maree Docia is a myth. Maree Docia is a ghost. Maree Docia is a legend.
