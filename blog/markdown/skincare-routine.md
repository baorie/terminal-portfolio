# My Skin Care Routine

Right, so there’s four steps to my skin care routine: wash, toner, benzoyl peroxide, moisturize.

## Wash
Stay away from washes and soaps that come with exfoliation built in. Anything that has those tiny beads in, sand, or stones or whatever, just stay away from that stuff. All it ends up doing is making tiny tears in your face which then turn into spots.

Use a foaming soap wash like [Boots Tea Tree & Witch Hazel Foaming Face Wash](http://www.boots.com/boots-tea-tree-and-witch-hazel-foaming-face-wash-150ml-10125605) or [Soap & Glory THE FAB PORE PURIFYING FOAM CLEANSER](http://www.boots.com/soap-and-glory-the-fab-pore-purifying-foam-cleanser-200ml-10212549#Gy1rYWVgPXC5MLJ9.99). Just find one that is essentially just a foaming soap to get rid of the oils and dirt on your face.

## Toner
Go out and find a 5% salicylic acid toner, preferably one that’s alcohol free. I use [this one from SR-Skincare](http://www.sr-skincare.co.uk/5-salicylic-acid-toner-alcohol-free-692-p.asp). It’s super cheap, it lasts forever, and it’s done wonders for my skin.

I only use the toner in the evening, but you can use it twice a day if you really need to. It stings for a couple of minutes when you put it on, so make sure it doesn’t go in your eyes.

## Benzoyl Peroxide
Everyone’s heard of this stuff now. I get any 5% stuff I can get my hands on, this [one from Boots is pretty solid](http://www.boots.com/acnecide-gel-30g-10187571).

## Moisturize
Right, this is gonna sound a but stupid, but I use sun cream as a moisturizer. It sorts out any dry skin from the benzoyl peroxide, plus it has the added benefit of protecting your skin from the sun, so less spots! Out of everything on this list, I think this is the thing that has benefited me the most.

Everyone’s skin is different, so what works for me might not work for you, but it’s worth a shot. In total I spend about £25 a month on this stuff, which is nothing compared to some other methods.
